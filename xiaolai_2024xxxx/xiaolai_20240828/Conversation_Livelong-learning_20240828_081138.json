With longer life expectancies, we need to adapt continuously."}, {"Alloy": "Exactly! If we stop learning, we risk falling behind in society."}, {"Nova": "But don\u2019t you think some people are just indifferent to learning? It\u2019s frustrating!"}, {"Alloy": "That\u2019s true. Some people seem to think they\u2019ve learned enough already. It's a pity!"}, {"Nova": "Right! And it\u2019s not just about personal growth; it also impacts family dynamics."}, {"Alloy": "Absolutely! Parents should model lifelong learning so their kids follow suit."}, {"Nova": "Do you believe that emphasizing education in families really makes a difference?"}, {"Alloy": "Without a doubt. Kids look up to their parents. If they see them learning, they'll be encouraged."}, {"Nova": "That\u2019s a great point!

Can it truly enhance learning?"}, {"Alloy": "It can, but sometimes tech also distracts more than it helps!"}, {"Nova": "That\u2019s right. It\u2019s a double-edged sword. I guess it all boils down to mindset."}]}]}
