In the grand tapestry of life, accumulation often gets a bad rap; it’s seen as a grueling process requiring unwavering determination, patience, and time. Yet, if we take a closer look, we’ll find that not all forms of accumulation demand relentless effort. In fact, some gains come simply from letting nature take its course.

Take tree planting, for instance. Sure, there’s work involved in planting the saplings each year — it’s hard graft that requires a bit of elbow grease. However, once those trees take root, they grow without us having to constantly hover over them. The daily growth is a passive affair; we reap the benefits without lifting a finger beyond that initial planting.

Investments operate on a similar idea. Sure, we actively choose and buy promising assets, but once they’re in our portfolio, we often sit back and let time work its magic. Years down the line, those assets may appreciate in value with minimal intervention from us. What seemed like an active choice morphs into a passive accumulation of wealth, like watching the grass grow.

Learning illustrates this principle perfectly as well. When we devote ourselves to reading, we aren’t merely memorizing vocabulary; we’re immersing ourselves in new ideas and concepts. Our vocabulary naturally expands in tandem, almost like a side effect of the joy of discovery. The effort is in the act of engaging with the material, while the growth happens quietly in the background.

In essence, accumulation doesn’t always have to feel like climbing a mountain. Sometimes, it’s about planting a seed, making a wise investment, or diving into a good book — all of which can yield results without constant struggle. With time, patience, and a bit of mindfulness, we can find that much of what we accumulate in life is simply the byproduct of our ongoing enthusiasm for growth.
