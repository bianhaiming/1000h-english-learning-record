Every challenge we face carves out pathways to growth, often in ways we can’t fully appreciate until we look back. Difficult situations can feel overwhelming, yet they hold the keys to developing our capabilities and resilience. Life’s greatest lessons rarely come wrapped in comfort and ease; rather, they bloom in the soil of adversity. 

For children, the temptation to swoop in and solve their problems can be strong for parents. After all, protecting our kids from hardship seems like an act of love. However, this well-meaning approach may inadvertently stifle their ability to navigate life's hurdles. Each time a parent resolves an issue for their child, they rob them of the chance to learn problem-solving skills that will serve them throughout life. Children aren’t born with the solutions; they need to wrestle with challenges to develop their own toolkits for tackling obstacles. 

Instead of stepping in, it’s far more beneficial to guide them through the thinking process. Encouraging them to explore various potential solutions teaches them to assess situations critically. Asking open-ended questions can promote their independence. For example, instead of providing direct answers, parents might ask, “What do you think could be a good way to approach this?” This type of dialogue nurtures responsibility and self-confidence in children.

Raising capable individuals means understanding that failure is simply part of the journey. Allowing kids to face and overcome difficulties helps them to build resilience, a key attribute that will empower them throughout their lives. If we rescue them from every storm, we risk turning them into adults who neither understand their own strength nor the value of perseverance. It’s in facing challenges that they learn to spread their wings, becoming more equipped to soar in life.
